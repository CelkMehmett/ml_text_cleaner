// This is a placeholder test for the stopword cleaner.
// It can be expanded with actual tests once the stopword cleaner is implemented.
// The stopword cleaner is expected to remove common words from text based on the specified language.
// For example, in Turkish, it should remove words like "bir", "ve", "çok" while keeping more meaningful words like "örnek".
// The cleaner should also handle different configurations such as custom stopwords or language-specific rules.
// The actual implementation of the stopword cleaner is expected to be in lib/cleaners/stopword_cleaner.dart
// and should be tested thoroughly to ensure it works as intended across various scenarios.
// The test can be expanded to include specific examples and expected outcomes for different languages.
// Once the stopword cleaner is implemented, this test can be updated to include specific cases and assertions.
